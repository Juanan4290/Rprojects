In this report we aim to explore the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database. This database tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States from 1950 to November 2011, including when and where they occur, as well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage.

Our specific goal is to know what types of wheather events are most harmful with respect to population health and which ones have the greatest economic consequences.
