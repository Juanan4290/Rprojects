# Rprojects:
Some projects developed in R:
- **ActivityMonitoringAnalysis**:This project analyzes data from personal activity monitoring device. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012 and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.
- **CachingMeanVectorAndInverseMatrix**: time-consuming computations for taking the mean of a numeric vector and the inverse of a matrix.
- **DataProducts**: Some shimy applications have been developed in this project: 
  1. Concrete Data Analysis 
  2. Next Word Predictor
- **ElectricPowerConsumption_ExploratoryDataAnalysis**: Our overall goal here is simply to examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007.
- **GettingAndCleaningData_CourseProject**: Getting Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones datasets and cleaning into one datase, calculating the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- **MostHarmfulEventsAcrossUS**: Our specific goal is to know what types of wheather events are most harmful with respect to population health and which ones have the greatest economic consequences.
- **MotorTrendCarAnalysis**: We analyze if an automatic transmission is better than manual transmission for MPG and quantifying the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions for Motor Trend Magazine.
- **StatisticalInference**: We have developed some T-tests using the Central Limit Theorem and analyzing the ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package.
- **WeightLiftingExercise**: In this project we use Decission Trees and Random Forest in the train set to predict how well people perform barbell lifts with an accuracy of 99.64% in the test set.
