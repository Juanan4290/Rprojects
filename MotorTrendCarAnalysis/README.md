### Summary
In this project we are going to work for *Motor Trend*, a magazine about the automobile industry. 
They are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon. 
They are particularly interested in the following two questions:

1. Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG?
2. Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions
