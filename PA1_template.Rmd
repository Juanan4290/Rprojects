Reproducible Data: Course Project 1
===================================
This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012 and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.

For this course project `data.table` and `dplry` packages are needed. So it is neccesary to install them before run the code.



### Loading and preprocessing the data

```r
activity=fread("activity.csv")
activity$date=as.Date(activity$date)
head(activity)
```

```
##    steps       date interval
## 1:    NA 2012-10-01        0
## 2:    NA 2012-10-01        5
## 3:    NA 2012-10-01       10
## 4:    NA 2012-10-01       15
## 5:    NA 2012-10-01       20
## 6:    NA 2012-10-01       25
```

### What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
For this part of the assignment, missing values in the dataset are ignored.


```r
stepsDay=group_by(activity,date)
stepsDay=summarize(stepsDay,totalSteps=sum(steps))

###Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
hist(stepsDay$totalSteps,
     xlab="Steps",main="Total number of steps taken each day")
```

```r
###Mean and median number of steps taken each day
mean(stepsDay$totalSteps,na.rm=T) #Mean
```

```
## [1] 10766.19
```

```r
median(stepsDay$totalSteps,na.rm=T) #Median
```

```
## [1] 10765
```

###What is the average daily activity pattern?
