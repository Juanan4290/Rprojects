### Shiny applications:
- **ConcreteDataAnalysisApp**: This application uses data from Concrete Compressive Strength dataset. 
These data were collected by I-Cheng Yeh to determine how the compressive strength of concrete is related to its ingredients and age. The application represents an scatterplot with the two variables you select in the left side panel. 
You can also group the data by the variable selected in the left side eyelash named "Grouping by" and fit a linear model based on variables selected in the left side panel.

- **NextWordPredictor**: This application creates a predictive text model using a large text corpus of documents as training data. For example, if a user types: *"I went to the ..."* the app would suggest the three most likely words that would replace "...", i.e. gym, store or mall.
