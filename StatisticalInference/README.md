## Summary
### Part 1: Central Limit Theorem
In this project we are going to investigate the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem. 
In the exponential distribution *lambda* is the rate parameter. The mean of exponential distribution is 1/lambda and the standard deviation is also 1/lambda.

### Part 2: Tooth Growth T-tests
In the second part of the project, we are going to analyze the ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package and some T-tests comparing variables have been carried out.
